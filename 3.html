  <h2>javascript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based script programming language. The language is mainly used within a web browser and has the ability to access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used for server side network programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha at first and later under the name LiveScript, which eventually became JavaScript. There are similarities between JavaScript and Sun Microsystems' Java and Syntax, but this is in fact because both languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript are not directly related Apart from names and phrases, there are more similarities to self than Java.</p>
