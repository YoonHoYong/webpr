  <h2>css</h2>
  <p>In the past, it was common to include design elements in HTML. In other words, putting all kinds of layout and design information into HTML has turned it into a document for design, not a structured document, which is the original purpose of HTML. The HTML source code alone made it difficult for even experts to know which document this document was, for example, the Table tag to draw up the table was used to construct the layout.

Therefore, the W3C announced the CSS with the aim of "Let's separate design elements completely from HTML to create structured HTML!" Accordingly, HTML recommends that all elements related to design be avoided, such as bgcolors. After the CSS announcement, new tags such as div, span, and section to help structure HTML documents were introduced, and style tags such as strike and font were switched to non-recommended tags and deleted altogether in HTML5. The table has been newly introduced to help structure the table, recommending that it be used only for expressing data in tabular form.

Structured HTML is the use of HTML tags for their intended use. For example, the h1 tag, which stands for the top title, is written at the level of the title of the document, and the text paragraph is divided by the <p> tag. This makes HTML much easier to recognize because most design elements are excluded. Here, 'easy to know' includes not only people (programmers), but also machines (web browsers). HTML, which is easy for machines to understand, is easy to change output format into various formats (which are applied by preparing and replacing CSS files separately for mobile devices and PCs), speed of decoding (packing) of documents is faster, and it is easier to implement dynamic functions. And in most cases, structured HTML is relatively smaller in document size than unstructured HTML in the past.

This makes collaboration between web designers and web programmers much easier because CSS is responsible for the parts needed for design. In addition, CSS can be inserted into HTML documents into a <style>tag, but it can be separated into separate files so that the same CSS can be used in other HTMLs. In other words, if a webpage is created, the style of a webpage, such as a font, can be changed at the same time by changing the contents of the entire page that is related to the web page, thereby maintaining consistency, reducing working hours, and reducing traffic. Traffic is even more beneficial in a mobile environment, and unless it is an unlimited rate system on the Internet, using as little packets as possible is the best way to avoid a charge bomb. It also has the advantage of faster loading.</p>
