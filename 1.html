<h1><a href="https://opentutorials.org/course/3084/18418">html이란 무엇인가?</a></h1><strong><u>HTML</u></strong> is the dominant markup language for web pages, meaning hypertext markup language (HiperText Markup Language, culture: hyper-text markup language). HTML provides a way to create structural documents with links, quotes and other items, as well as represent structural meanings for texts such as titles, paragraphs, lists, etc. And it can be used to embed images and objects and create interactive forms. HTML is created in HTML element form, consisting of "tags" surrounded by angle brackets in web page content. HTML can include or recall JavaScripts that affect the behavior of HTML processing devices such as web browsers and scripts such as CSS that define the appearance and placement of text and other items. The W3C, co-director of the HTML and CSS standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear, expressive markups.
